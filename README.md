# Ackermann Steering Vehicle Simulation

This is a forked repository. 
It was forked to port the simulation to ros2 humble with gazebo classic

## ‚ú® About

This package, built with ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco and Gazebo Harmonic, launches a simulation of an Ackermann steering vehicle. The vehicle model includes steering angle and velocity control, along with an embedded front camera that streams live images for vision-based tasks. This setup could be used for developing and testing autonomous driving algorithms in a simulated environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Linux Setup

This project is designed for Linux Ubuntu 24.04. It may work on other versions or distributions, but some adjustments could be necessary. To avoid changing your OS, you can use [Docker](#docker-usage) for an easier and more consistent setup across environments.

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository into your ```workspace/src``` folder. If you don't have a workspace set up, you can learn more about creating one in the [ROS 2 workspace tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html).

```bash
cd <path_to_your_workspace>/src
git clone git@github.com:lucasmazz/gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle.git
```

### Build the Package
Source the ROS 2 environment and build the package:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
cd <path_to_your_workspace>
colcon build
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Setup

**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** is required to build and run this project using the Docker setup. It ensures a consistent environment and simplifies dependency management across different systems. Make sure Docker is properly installed and running on your machine before proceeding with the build and execution steps.

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to a preferred location on your machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lucasmazz/gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle.git
```

### Build the Container

Navigate to the project directory and run the `build_docker.sh` script to build the Docker container. Make sure you're inside the folder, as the script depends on local files. The build may take a while, depending on your internet speed and system performance.

```bash
cd gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle
./build_docker.sh
```

### Run the Container

To run the Docker container, make sure you're in the project directory and execute the `run_docker.sh` script. This will open a command line with the environment fully configured. You can run this script as many times as needed, and each time it will launch a new command line session inside the Docker container, ready to execute commands within the configured environment.

```bash
cd gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle
./run_docker.sh
```

For instance, if you need to run the simulation, simply execute the `run_docker.sh` script to open a command line inside the Docker container and execute the following command:

```bash
cd gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle
./run_docker.sh
ros2 launch gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle vehicle.launch.py
```

To use the joystick, open a new command line inside the Docker container by running the `run_docker.sh` script again in a new terminal. Once inside, execute the following command:

```bash
cd gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle
./run_docker.sh
ros2 launch gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle joystick.launch.py
```

For more advanced usage and details, please refer to the next section of the documentation.

## üöÄ Usage

### Launch the Vehicle

After building the package, launch the ```vehicle.launch.py``` file from the ```gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle``` package:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
cd <path_to_your_workspace>
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle vehicle.launch.py
```

#### Arguments

To launch the robot in a specified world with a custom initial pose, run the ```vehicle.launch.py``` file and specify the world path and robot pose arguments.

- **world**: Path to the world file
- **x**: Initial x-coordinate of the robot
- **y**: Initial y-coordinate of the robot
- **z**: Initial z-coordinate of the robot
- **R**: Initial roll orientation
- **P**: Initial pitch orientation
- **Y**: Initial yaw orientation

In the following example, the robot starts at position (x, y, z) = (1.0, 2.0, 0.5) with a yaw of 1.57 radians in the specified world:

```bash
ros2 launch gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle vehicle.launch.py world:=/path_to_world/world.sdf x:=1.0 y:=2.0 z:=0.5 R:=0.0 P:=0.0 Y:=1.57
```

### Control the Vehicle

#### Topics

The vehicle can be controlled by publishing the steering angle in radians and velocity in meters per second to the respective topics:

```bash
/steering_angle
/velocity
```

The following topics can be subscribed to access the camera image and retrieve its information:

```bash
/camera/image_raw
/camera/info
```

#### Joystick

To control the vehicle, you can use a video game joystick by launching ```joystick.launch.py```. This launch file starts the joystick_controller node, designed specifically for compatibility with an Xbox One joystick, to interface with the ```velocity``` and ```steering_angle``` topics.

To launch the ```joystick.launch.py```, run the following commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
cd <path_to_your_workspace>
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch gazebo_ackermann_steering_vehicle joystick.launch.py
```
